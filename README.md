Project 1: Website Vulnerability Scanner (Python)
1. Introduction
Web applications are often targeted by hackers due to misconfigured headers, open directories, or weak forms that may allow attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). This project implements a Website Vulnerability Scanner in Python that automates the process of identifying common web security issues.
2. Objective
- To develop a Python tool that scans websites for security vulnerabilities.
- To check for missing or weak HTTP security headers.
- To identify forms that might be susceptible to injection attacks.
3. Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3.14
Libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4
Platform: Windows/Linux

Project 2: Network Packet Sniffer (Python + Scapy)
1. Introduction
Network security is a critical part of cybersecurity. Hackers often attempt Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or packet sniffing attacks to steal sensitive information. This project implements a Network Packet Sniffer using Python and the Scapy library to capture and analyze packets in real time.
2. Objective
- To capture live network traffic.
- To analyze IP packets and TCP payloads.
- To detect suspicious traffic such as credential leaks or ARP spoofing attempts.
3. Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3.14
Libraries: scapy
Platform: Linux/Windows (requires administrator/root permissions)
